Tommy & Esa-Matti's Working Project
-----------------------------------

We are learning TDD with Jasmine and JavaScript to create simple Collection class. To run the tests, we go to Run -> Run Configurations -> Jasmine Tests.
From the command line, we can run tests using command: node run_tests.js spec/*.js

We also have an implementation of Conway's Game of Life. To run this we just right click conway_tommy.js and say "Run". From command line, we can run it
via command "node conway_tommy".

We even have a web server that came with Cloud9 when we created this project in our workspace called server.js which we haven't used.

To save to github, we open a new Terminal window with Window -> New Terminal. Then git add -A followed by git commit -m "commit message" and finally 
git push origin master to copy the latest repo out to github using our github credentials.
